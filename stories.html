                   <span id="fsize">That made me very happy. I thought princesses were great they lived in castles and got to eat lots of cake! They also had
                                one-dimensional personalities and a tendency to be ditzy dependent idiots, but I didn’t see that
                                then. I was more interested in their glamorous lifestyles than their pretty faces, so it never really
                                occurred to me that being a princess was a privilege reserved for slim white girls with long hair
                                and full lips.</span>

                                <span id="text">Stunning physical beauty, just like incredibly high intellect, is a privilege given to a chosen few. The sooner we stop pretending that everyone can be physically flawless, the better.There are so many amazing qualities for women to aspire to  independence, wisdom or courage to name a few  that shining a spotlight on physical beauty alone is awfully limiting.It’s just not true that “every girl is a princess”  not in the superficial physical sense, anyway.
                                         As unfair as it seems, some women will always be more Ursula than Ariel. Internal beauty is another matter altogether, because not even a heart of gold can save your face from being deeply asymmetrical.The sooner we realise that the universality of female beauty is just a convenient lie repeated to us by profit-making businesses and well-meaning aunties, the sooner we will get rid of our feelings of inadequacy and finally make space for the things that really matter in life.Instead of concentrating on their appearance, maybe we should tell little girls something else – like “every girl is worthy of love and respect, regardless of what she looks like”.<br>

                        <span id="fsize">I’m an independent girl. I travel the world alone, run my own business and do my own taxes.But I also love being in a relationship.
                                        I crave the closeness and intimacy, wearing my heart on my sleeve and sharing it with another person.
                                        As you might know if you’ve been following me for a while, I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a
                                        year now and we even live together now. In Phoebe-from-Friends‘ words, I feel like I’ve found my
                                        lobster. It wasn’t always like that though. Throughout my four year stint as a university student
                                        I was pretty much your ultimate single girl – zero commitments, aside from RSVPing yes to every single
                                        party invite that came my way.</span>


                        <div>
                                <br>
                                <span id="text1">A good long-lasting relationship is the start of a great adventure. If you work at a relationship it will grow with you over time and add a new layer of depth to your life.
                                        <br>        
                                        1. Be there. In order to form a meaningful connection with someone you need to spend time with them. That doesn’t just mean being physically present, but being present in the moment.
                                                <br>
                                                2. Be playful. If you don’t have fun together, why would you even bother with this relationship? Yes, this extends to being physical. Not everyone is fully comfortable with intimacy and building up the necessary level of trust may take time, of course.
                                                <br>
                                                3. Be vulnerable. Being emotionally open is one of the hardest things you have to do in a relationship. Laying all your feelings bare is absolutely terrifying.
                                                <br>
                                               4. Nobody is perfect and, as much as I hate to say it, neither are you. But guess what – the only person expecting you to be perfect is also you!
                                                And that’s it – the end of my independent girl’s guide to healthy relationships. This advice obviously isn’t all the be-all and end-all of love, but it’s a good start.

                        <h1 style="color:#ff8a00">Reasons To Be Happy Right Now</h1>
                        <span id="fsize">According to studies millennials are the most stressed and depressed generation yet. With headlines full of economic hardships,
                                        natural disasters and terrorist attacks we don’t seem to have many reasons to be happy right now.
                                        But the truth is we’ve never lived in such peaceful times. This excerpt from ‘The World Is Not Falling
                                        Apart‘ sums it up really well: “The kinds of violence to which most people are vulnerable – homicide,
                                        rape, battering, child abuse – have been in steady decline in most of the world. Autocracy is giving
                                        way to democracy. Wars between states – by far the most destructive of all conflicts – are all but
                                        obsolete.”</span>

                        <div>
                                <br>
                                <span id="text2">I think the reason for our unhappiness partly lies in procrastination. Procrastination is something our generation is very good at – how could we not be with all those cute cat videos and personality quizzes clogging up our newsfeeds? It makes me wonder if modern-day technology distracts us from being happy.
                                        <br>        
                                        1. You’re alive. Let’s start with the basics – you’re alive and that’s pretty damn amazing.
                                        <br>       
                                        2. The only time that truly exists is now. The past is behind you, the future is far ahead and you can only live in the moment. That is not just a line, it’s also the truth.
                                        <br>      
                                        3. Your life could drastically change. I don’t mean to be a wet-blanket or to downright scare you, but the truth is that there are forces beyond our control that can completely alter the trajectory of our life in one fell swoop. Reflecting on what your life would be like without certain privileges is an effective way of making yourself feel grateful for what you do have.
                                        <br>       
                                        4. Every day is an opportunity to change your life. The past is the past and it’s never too late to completely start over. Unhappy with your career? Set aside an hour today to figure out what you’d rather be doing and then take steps every day toward that goal. Unhappy with your partner? Have an honest conversation and figure out if your relationship is worth saving.
                                        <br>       
                                        5. Failure is a stepping stone to greatness. If you feel like nothing in your life is going according to plan just think about Thomas Edison, the inventor of modern-day light bulbs. He went through more than ten thousand prototypes before getting it right.

                        <span id="fsize">I don’t know about you, but my hand is waving around in the air like Hermione Granger’s. Mornings have a bad effect on me
                                         I’m snappy, moody and the polar opposite of my best self. But I’m not one to sit idly by when I
                                        see room for improvement in my life. I may not be a morning person (who is anyway?), but that doesn’t
                                        mean I can’t wake up happy and fabulous. In fact, there are lots of tricks to wake up happy and fabulous!
                                        If you also struggle with getting up in the morning, try this simple morning routine… The first step
                                        to waking up happy actually starts before you even go to bed. At the end of every day, write down
                                        a list of things that made you happy  anything from a lady on the train complimenting your necklace
                                        to a double rainbow in the sky. Your entries can be as silly or profound as you’d like, as long as
                                        they make you smile and beam with pride at your own accomplishments.</span>

                                                Now that you’re full of positive life force, get out of the bed and do some light exercise. You can do something more strenuous if you’d like, but some stretches and a few kicks to get the blood flowing should do the trick. The key is making your body and mind feel more awake, kick-starting your appetite and your will to get shizz done!        
                                        I don’t know about you, but I always get my best ideas in the shower. It’s probably the only place where I can completely tune out the white noise of the outside world while simultaneously not feeling like I should be working or doing something more productive. So hop in the shower, use all your lovely-smelling products, lather up and scrub all the dirt off – yes, that includes negative thoughts!
                                        It’s possible that some of the tasks will turn out to be useless or that a few issues will have magically fixed themselves already – but a good list will propel you forward and give you a sense of accomplishment when you look over it at the end of the day. Don’t be scared to give yourself ambitious goals, but keep it realistic given the timeframe. Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither was any million dollar start-up or successful blog!

                I looked down at my nondescript black shoes, biting my lip. That one simple question – one which
                used to fill me with unimaginable dread – was wrapping itself around my brain, making it hard to
                think: “What would you like to do?” My eyes glued to the blurry outlines of my feet, I sighed. “I
                don’t mind. What would you like to do?” For years, that was my mantra. I didn’t want to make waves.
                I wanted to be loved – universally and without question. Many people live their entire lives with
                a similar outlook, swallowing their opinions and giving voice to those of others instead. This is
                especially true of us, women, who are praised for things like niceness, politeness and friendliness.
                “I don’t mind. What would you like to do?” Has there ever been a better motto for women worldwide?</span>
                        
                        <div>
                                <br>
                                <span id="text4" >If you want to travel the world but your job does not give you enough flexibility, do the unthinkable and wave it goodbye. Not ready to settle down and start a family despite everyone’s insistence that you should? Listen to your heart and forge your own path! And, for the love of all that is good, do not apologise for doing so.
                                                Do realise that we are all in this together though and, just as you are the main star on your stage, everyone you meet has the prerogative to fight for their dreams. Never compromise your integrity, but try to accommodate other people’s wishes if they don’t hinder you from achieving your own. Joy is contagious and doing good is addictive in the best way possible!

                                        Based on Danny Wallace’s novel by the same name, the movie “Yes Man” has a simple premise – what if you said “yes” to every opportunity that came your way? In short, you would probably go crazy. But what if you picked one activity a week – an activity which excites and scares you in equal measure – and went for it? Facing your fears head-on puts you in the driver’s seat and allows you to feel like you’re fully in control of your life. After all, as scary as that may seem, you are the main character of your life and it is completely up to you which way you steer it.
