                    <h2>Aloo chaat (South Asia)</h2>
                    <p>Aloo chaat, a dish made with pieces of boiled and fried potatoes mixed with spices and chutney, is popular
                        throughout South Asia, but particularly so in Pakistan and northern India, as well as parts of the
                        Indian province of West Bengal and the Bangladeshi region of Sylhet. Eaten as a snack, a side dish
                        or a light meal, aloo chaat can vary by region in terms of specific spices and chutneys used.Aloo
                        chaat is mainly a street food. It can be served as a snack, a side dish or a light meal. It is made
                        from boiled and fried cubed potatoes served with chat masala. It is a versatile dish that has many
                        regional variations. The word aloo means potatoes in Hindi and the word chaat is derived from Hindi
                        word chatna which means tasting. Thus, aloo chaat means a savory potato snack. it is popular in North
                        India, West Bengal in Eastern India, Pakistan and also in parts of Sylhet Division of Bangladesh.

                    <h2>Gelato (Italy)</h2>
                    <p> While gelato is the Italian word for ice cream, what some people may not realize about Italian gelato
                        is that is quite different from ice cream. Made with milk, cream and sugar and then flavored with
                        nuts, fruit or other flavorings, gelato is much lower in fat than traditional American ice cream.
                        By Italian law, it must be made of 3.5 percent butterfat (as opposed to the 10 percent butterfat
                        dictated for ice cream by American law). You’ll also find that gelato has more flavor and less air
                        whipped into it than ice cream, giving it a richness that has made it popular throughout Italy as
                        well as the rest of the world.Gelato in its modern form is credited to the Italian chef Francesco
                        Procopio dei Coltelli who in the late 1600s opened his “Café Procope” in Paris and introduced gelato
                        at his café, earning notability first in Paris and then in the rest of Europe. Thanks to his gelato,
                        Procopio not only obtained French citizenship, but also got an exclusive royal licence issued by
                        the Sun King Louis XIV, making him at the time the sole producer of the frozen dessert in the kingdom.</p>

                    <h2>Anticucho (Peru)</h2>
                    <p>Anticuchos are a kebab-like street food found in Peru that can consist of any kind of meat but are most
                        popularly made of beef heart. The meat is marinated in vinegar and spices such as garlic, cumin and
                        ají pepper before being roasted on a skewer, the meat pieces alternating with vegetables such as
                        peppers, onions, mushrooms and carrots. Seasoned with salt, as well as sometimes vinegar or lemon
                        juice, anticuchos are usually served with a traditional sauce made with garlic, cilantro, onion,
                        lemon juice, beer and vinegar, as well as a piece of bread or a boiled potato.Although Anticuchos
                        are of Pre-Columbian origin, modern Anticuchos can be traced as far back as the 16th century, when
                        they were first encountered by the Spanish conquistadors. It was at this time that European ingredients
                        such as garlic were added, and beef began to replace the traditional llama that was used at the time
                        of the Inca Empire. It was a popular dish among the inhabitants of the Inca Empire, and it is currently
                        popular throughout most South American countries. Americanized versions of anticuchos are sometimes
                        made of non-organ meats.</p>

                    <p>Made of sliced eggplant that is battered and then fried or deep-fried in oil, beguni is a Bengali snack
                        found in Bangladesh, as well as the Indian province of West Bengal. Served with rice, it is a popular

                        Bengali Muslim households throughout the Indian subcontinent.The dish may be prepared by coating
                        eggplant with besan paste and then frying the pieces in oil. The eggplant is usually cut longitudinally
                        (Bengali: বেগুন begun) and dipped in a batter of Bengal gram flour with salt and turmeric, and deep-fried
                        in mustard oil. Sometimes a small amount of poppy seeds is added to the batter. Some people prefer
                        adding a small amount of baking powder to the batter to make it more crunchy. </p>

                    <h2>Gyro (Greece)</h2>
                    <p> A gyro is a Greek meat preparation in which the meat — traditionally lamb, chicken, or pork — is cooked
                        on a vertical rotisserie and then sliced off to be served in a wrap of flatbread (usually pita) filled
                        with tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce, as well as sometimes fries. Gyro meat, which can also be
                        made of beef or veal, is usually spiced with paprika, garlic powder, oregano, pepper and dried parsley,
                        as well as sometimes cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg and sumac among other spices.According to Margaret Garlic,
                        it was she who first came up with the idea to mass-produce gyros meat cones, after watching a demonstration
                        by a Greek restaurant owner carving gyros on the What's My Line? television show. She convinced her
                        husband John Garlic, a Jewish former Marine and then Cadillac salesman, of the idea. After obtaining
                        a recipe from a Greek chef in Chicago, the couple rented a space in a sausage plant in Milwaukee
                        and began operating the world's first assembly line producing gyros meat from beef and lamb trimmings</p>

                    <h2>Bunny chow (South Africa)</h2>
                    <p> Often referred to as simply a “bunny” by locals, bunny chow is a South African street food that originated
                        with the Indian community in the city of Durban. A bread loaf is hollowed out and then filled with
                        curry, usually mutton, lamb, chicken or bean. The dish, which is traditionally eaten by hand, is
                        also usually accompanied by a side of salad made up of grated carrots, onion and chili.Stories of
                        the origin of bunny chow date as far back as the migrant Indian workers' arrival in South Africa.
                        One account suggests that said Indian laborers who came to work the sugar cane plantations of Kwazulu-Natal
                        (Port Natal) required a way of carrying their lunches to the field, a hollowed-out loaf of bread
                        was a convenient way to transport their vegetarian curries. Meat-based fillings came later. The use
                        of a loaf of white bread can also be ascribed to the lack of the traditional roti bread as well as
                        its weak structure; thus the cheap loaf, widely available at local stores, would be an optimal substitute
                        vessel for the curry.</p>

                    <h2>Arepa (Colombia and Venezuela)</h2>
                    <p>Arepas are a staple in the Colombian and Venezuelan diets. These soft, thick patties are made with either
                        ground maize kernels, maize flour or maize meal, which is then mixed with water and salt, as well
                        as sometimes butter, eggs, milk or oil. Baked, boiled, fried, grilled or steamed, arepas can vary
                        in size, flavor and color, and very often are stuffed or topped with meat, cheese, eggs, tomatoes
                        or salad, or even eaten plain as a side to a meal. Arepas can also be split to serve as the bread
                        of a sandwich, and are often served with cheese, avocado, or cuajada a type of milk curd.he flour
                        is mixed with water and salt, and occasionally oil, butter, eggs, and/or milk. Because the flour
                        is already cooked, the blend forms into patties easily. After being kneaded and formed, the patties
                        are fried, grilled, or baked. This production of maize is unusual for not using the nixtamalization
                        (alkali cooking) process to remove the pericarp of the kernels. This makes arepa flour different
                        from masa flour, which is used to make tortillas.</p>

                    <h2>Calzone (Italy)</h2>
                    <p> Calzones are actually folded over pizzas and were invented in Naples, like the pizza itself. Made with
                        salted bread dough that is stuffed with ham, salami or vegetables, as well as mozzarella, ricotta
                        and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, calzones are baked in the oven. Regional varieties across Italy
                        exist, with ingredients including typical pizza toppings as well as foods such as eggs or potatoes.
                        While a calzone can be quite a large meal, Italian street vendors often sell them in a smaller size
                        that can easily be eaten on the go.Traditional calzone dough, consisting of flour, yeast, olive oil,
                        water and salt, is kneaded and rolled into medium-sized disks. Each is then filled with cheeses such
                        as ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, provolone, and other traditional vegetables or meats. The dough
                        is then folded in half over the filling and sealed with an egg mixture in a half-moon shape, or is
                        sometimes shaped into a ball by pinching and sealing all the edges at the top. It is then either
                        baked or fried.</p>
