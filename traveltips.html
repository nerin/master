                    <h2 class="frame-1">Something I am always careful about is not taking part in harmful
                        activities/attractions while travelling. It’s
                        very irresponsible to attend activities where animals, and even some cases humans, aren’t
                        treated properly. A few examples are visiting elephant riding tours and circuses where the elephants aremistreated or buying
                        Kopi Luwak where the civets are harmed and mistreated in the process.<br> -Shelby, The Fernweh

                    </h2>
                    <h2 class="frame-2">You don’t have to compromise your beauty routine (or your ethics!) to get
                        through airport security. Look for
                        solid versions of shampoos, conditioners, and even toothpaste! My favorite brand to use is Lush,
                        a completely
                        cruelty-free brand that has everything to keep you looking and smelling fresh. Their toothy tabs
                        – solid
                        toothpaste – have the first recyclable toothpaste container ever!

                        <br> -Megan, Beat Broke Backpacking</h2>
                    <h2 class="frame-3">If you’re looking to reduce your carbon footprint, it can be as easy as choosing
                        to walk everywhere. Whenever
                        I get to a new city, I walk around for hours. It’s not only environmentally friendly, but it is
                        also one
                        of the best ways to get your bearings in a new city and learn how to navigate it.

                        <br>-Mimi, The Atlas Heart</h2>
                    <h2 class="frame-4"> As of last year, passenger jets are the fastest-growing source of greenhouse
                        gas emissions! So while yes, it
                        is really fun to hop on a plane and head across the world, don’t be afraid to embrace
                        close-to-home travel
                        as an alternative (much greener!) alternative. Trawl Instagram, hit up local tourism boards, and
                        travel with
                        the sense of wonder you usually reserve for abroad – you’ll be surprised at what amazing
                        discoveries you’ll
                        make just outside your door!

                        <br>-Polly, Green Indy</h2>


                    <h2 class="frame-5"> On top of using alternative means of transportation as walking and biking to
                        move around, what really helps is
                        putting together several destinations in one trip to avoid a huge carbon footprint flying to
                        just one destination
                        each time. I know it is difficult to simply not book all those low-cost flights and fill your
                        weekends with
                        city getaways (especially if you are in Europe) but the environment will benefit of this big
                        time in the
                        end.

                        <br> -Inma, A World To Travel</h2>

                    <h2 class="frame-6"> Read up on the local culture and learn a few words of the local language. Even
                        if it’s just “please” and “thank
                        you,” being respectful to the local people you’re visiting will earn you respect in return.
                        Taking the time
                        to learn about the cultural mannerisms and ettiquette is also very helpful to avoid a faux pas,
                        such as not
                        tipping enough, eating with the wrong hand (this really happens), or wearing “inappropriate”
                        colors.

                        <br> -Kaitlin, Around the World in Katy Days</h2>

                    <h2 class="frame-7"> Save paper. Instead of grabbing maps from every city you visit, take a picture
                        of it from your phone and refer
                        to it from there!

                        <br> -Isabel, Bel Around The World</h2>


                    <h2 class="frame-8"> Check whether you can bring useful items for the local community through a
                        wonderful organisation called Pack
                        For a Purpose. I have no affiliation with them, I just think it’s a brilliant idea. You start by
                        selecting
                        your destination country, then your lodging and choose from the list of items that are needed –
                        whether it’s
                        art supplies, Lego, frisbees, or flash reading cards. In some cases you can even get to meet the
                        recipients
                        like local schools!

                        <br> -Suze, Luxury Columnist</h2>

                    <h2 class="frame-9"> For tours and accommodations – especially in more remote parts of developing
                        countries! – always ask ahead what
                        percentage of the staff is locally hired and what initiatives are done for the local community.
                        I love knowing
                        that my money is going directly back to the communities that I’m visiting to help the people I
                        meet.

                        <br>-Karen, Wanderlusting K</h2>

                    <h2 class="frame-10"> No matter where you go, a towel is always on the packing list. Some are
                        fortunate enough to stay at luxury hotels
                        in which case you may not need one, but not everyone has that option. I always pack my
                        microfibre quick dry
                        towel. It is compact, extremely quick to absorb and dry after, and has anti-bacterial
                        properties! What more
                        could you want?!

                        <br> -Tracey, Gone Globelle</h2>


                    <h2 class="frame-11"> Don’t just focus on how you can be more responsible while travelling – think
                        about how your everyday actions
                        impact the environment and the people around you. Can you walk instead of driving? How about
                        doing your daily
                        shop at a local market instead of a big chain? Maybe you can skip meat and dairy a few days a
                        week? All these
                        small decisions add up to something great and wonderful.
