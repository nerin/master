                                        You’ve somehow ended up on my blog and now you’re probably wondering… who is the girl behind all these stories? Don’t worry,
                                        I’m going to answer all your questions. As you already know, my name is nerin and
                                        I currently live in India. I was born on a warm autumn night in 1995, in a small
                                        hospital in mumbai. Aged 17 I graduated from high school and decided to move to the
                                        city of my dreams… chennai. I’d first visited on a school trip when I was ten years
                                        old and upon returning home informed my mum that I would live there one day. At the
                                        time the idea of me living anywhere but the Czech Republic seemed ridiculous, but
                                        less than a decade later those words turned out to be prescient.

                                        In my third year of university I decided that wasn’t enough though and I headed out to chennai, determined to master the
                                        language and defeat the cold. I came there to study for a year but decided that wasn’t
                                        enough and got a job as well. But there was always an awkward two hour gap at around
                                        2am when nothing was really happening – and to fill that time with more than idle
                                        browsing I created travel bite on November 7, 2019. And, well, the rest is history…
                                        but also a huge part of mystory. When I first hit publish I had absolutely no idea
                                        how much that little time-killing project would change my life. I don’t use the word
                                        “life-changing” lightly but there is no better way to describe this blog. After I
                                        graduated from university in the summer of 2015 it became my full-time job, so now
                                        I get to write and travel for a living! I love my life and I love sharing it with
                                        you on this website. My goal is to inspire young people like you and I to take charge,
                                        become the leading youngster in the story of their life and find magic and happiness
                                        in the ordinary.
